I strive to better understand the history of the Universe, from the beginning of Inflation to the late time evolution of galaxies and dark matter halos. I am also constantly looking for ways statistical methods and computational techniques can be applied to cosmology such as new sampling algorithms for parameter inference, building emulators of cosmological models with machine learning, Hamiltonian motivated optimizers.

I'm currently a physics graduate student at Stanford University. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago, with a bachelor of arts in physics. In the past I have also worked in experimental high energy physics and material science.

You can find my most up to date CV [here](assets/pdf/Henry_Zheng_Resume.pdf).



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
