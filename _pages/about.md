Welcome to my page! I am a physics PhD candidate at Stanford University. I seek to better understand the history of the Universe, from the beginning of Inflation to the late time evolution of galaxies and dark matter halos. I am also constantly looking for ways statistical methods and computational techniques can be applied to cosmology such as new sampling algorithms for parameter inference, building emulators of cosmological models with machine learning, Hamiltonian motivated optimizers.

Prior to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago, with a bachelor of arts in physics. In the past I have also worked in experimental high energy physics and material science.

You can find my most up to date CV [here](assets/pdf/Henry_Zheng_Resume.pdf).
